# E2E Test

Generate Playwright tests for given requirement defined by $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Gather context

Gather context information and be extremelly concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision:

- Explore `client/src/app/` to gather information of the code that generates the page we want to test
- Explore `e2e/tests/ui/` to gather common patterns

## Phase 2: Take action

- Spawn a `playwright-test-planner` sub-agent to draft a plan. Provide the data gathered at "Phase 1" as an input. Ask questions if needed to clarify plan
- Wait for the test plan generated by the `playwright-test-planner` sub-agent and then Spawn a `playwright-test-generator` using the plan as an input

## Phase 3: Verify results

### Heal results
- Spawn a `playwright-test-healer` sub-agent to fix failing tests and use the sub-agent `playwright-test-executor` for executing the tests; provide the generated test file paths as input.
- Verify all tests pass successfully
- If tests fail, iterate for tests to pass
- Report final status with test coverage summary

### Final output:
- Short summary of coverage and potential gaps
- List of generated test files with pass/fail status
- Recommendations for additional test scenarios if needed
